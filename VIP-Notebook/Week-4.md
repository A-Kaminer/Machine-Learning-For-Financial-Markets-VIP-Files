# Week 2 (January 30 - February 5)

## January 30

### Deciding Subteams (30 minutes)

Division into subteams is starting, and it looks like we'll break into something
like 4 subteams. Big props to Elliot Willner for taking it upon himself to 
organize that. I think I'm probably going to be on the team looking into asset
pricing. Because my proposal didn't fit well with really any of the others, 
I get to choose wherever I want to go, and asset pricing is very in line with
quant stuff, which I want to do. Looking forward to starting work on actual
research.

### Data Analysis in Python Course (1.5 hours)

I did lectures 4 and 5. Learning lots of interesting stuff. I think that this
course will give me the skills I need going forward.
