# Week 4 (January 30 - February 5)

## January 30

### Deciding Subteams (30 minutes)

Division into subteams is starting, and it looks like we'll break into something
like 4 subteams. Big props to Elliot Willner for taking it upon himself to 
organize that. I think I'm probably going to be on the team looking into asset
pricing. Because my proposal didn't fit well with really any of the others, 
I get to choose wherever I want to go, and asset pricing is very in line with
quant stuff, which I want to do. Looking forward to starting work on actual
research.

### Data Analysis in Python Course (3 hours)

I did lectures 4,5, and 7. Learning lots of interesting stuff. I think that this
course will give me the skills I need going forward. It is also kind of mind 
bending sometimes.

## February 3

### Meeting Notes (1 hour)

We got into teams. I'm on the asset pricing subteam with Sid and Tia. There
is another asset pricing subteam that will be working basically in parallel 
with us. It's made up of Elizabeth, Vikram, and Elliot. Seems like we'll be
working on some sort of asset pricing by focusing on intrinsic value. Basically
just quant stuff.
