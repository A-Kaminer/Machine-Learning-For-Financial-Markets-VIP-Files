### Working on ititial assignment

I spent about an hour working on the coding assignment. It's tricky because I 
have no idea how the statistics work. Lots of unfamiliar letters and words.
I'm familiar with numpy at least so hopefully it won't be too bad. Unfortunately
I can't get my code to do what I want it to do, so I'm taking a break.
